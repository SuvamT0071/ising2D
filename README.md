![Gemini_Generated_Image_w752xtw752xtw752](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d6084d8-462b-4940-b3f3-48e50c3b0414)

## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Ising model simulation using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The code allows for studying phase transitions in magnetic systems, computing specific heat, mean energy, magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility for a given lattice.

## Features
- Generate random 2D Ising spin configurations
- Compute system energy with free and periodic boundary conditions
- Simulate spin dynamics using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
- Compute specific heat, mean energy, magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility
- Support for periodic boundary conditions (PBC)
- Support for triangular and square lattices
- Visualise frustrated magnetism
- Support for both ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic plots and calculations

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuvamT0071/ising2D.git
cd ising2D/isingmetro
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install dependencies manually:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tqdm
```
To install isingmetro, use pip:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/SuvamT0071/ising2D.git
```
## Usage

### 1. Generate a Random Grid
```python
from isingmetro import grid_maker

grid = grid_maker(nrows=10, ncols=10)
print(grid)
```

### 2. Compute Energy
```python
from isingmetro import compute_energy

energy = compute_energy(grid)
print("Energy:", energy)
```

### 3. Run the Ising Model Simulation
```python
from isingmetro import ising_model

nsamples = 10000
temperature = 2.5
saved_energies, final_grid = ising_model(nsamples, temperature, grid)
print("Final Grid:", final_grid)
```

### 4. Compute Specific Heat
```python
from isingmetro import specific_heat

temp_range = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
Cv, updated_Cv = specific_heat(grid, temp_range)
print("Specific Heat:", Cv)
```

### 5. Compute Magnetization
```python
from isingmetro import magnetize

magnetization = magnetize(grid, temp_range)
print("Magnetization:", magnetization)
```
